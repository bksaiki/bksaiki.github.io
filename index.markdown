My name is Brett Saiki.
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Washington
  double-majoring in computer engineering and mathematics.
I am do research on computer number systems and term-rewriting techniques
  alongside my advisers [Zach Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/)
  and [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com/).
I currently work on projects like Herbie, Ruler, and FPBench.

# Research

 - [Herbie](https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie) - a tool for minimizing error
    in floating-point expressions.

 - [FPBench](https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench) - a collection of benchmarks,
    compilers, and standards for the floating-point research community.

 - [Ruler](https://github.com/uwplse/ruler) - a framework for synthesizing
    rewrite rules for a particular domain.

# Side Projects

 - [Minim](https://github.com/bksaiki/Minim) - a Scheme-like language inspired by recent work in Racket.

 - [ENL](https://github.com/bksaiki/ENL) - a library of alternate number systems written in C.
    Currently supports quad-double."

 - [generic-flonum](https://docs.racket-lang.org/generic-flonum/index.html) -
    Racket interface for MPFR that supports subnormal numbers and variable exponent sizes.

# Resources

 - [FPBench community](https://fpbench.org) - FPBench, FPCore, number systems, and more.
    Please start here if you want to know more about the FPBench Project.
  
 - [Herbie web demo](https://herbie.uwplse.org/demo) - an interactive page
