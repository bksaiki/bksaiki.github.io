# About

My name is Brett Saiki.
I am a graduate student at the University of Washington.
I do research in programming languages, computer number systems,
  and term rewriting alongside my advisors
  [Zach Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/) and
  [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com/).
I currently work on projects like Herbie, Ruler, and FPBench.

# Research

 - [Herbie](https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie) - a tool for minimizing error
    in floating-point expressions.

 - [FPBench](https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench) - a collection of benchmarks,
    compilers, and standards for the floating-point research community.

 - [Ruler](https://github.com/uwplse/ruler) - a framework for synthesizing
    rewrite rules for a particular domain.
