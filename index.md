# About

My name is Brett Saiki.
I am an industrial PhD student at the University of Washington
  advised by [Zachary Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/) and
  the [Numerical Hardware Group](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/open/graphics-numerical-hardware/overview.html)
  at Intel.
I do research in programming languages, computer number systems,
  term rewriting for hardware design.

# Research

 - [Herbie](https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie) - a tool for minimizing error
    in floating-point expressions.

 - [FPBench](https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench) - a collection of benchmarks,
    compilers, and standards for the floating-point research community.

 - [Ruler](https://github.com/uwplse/ruler) - a framework for synthesizing
    rewrite rules for a particular domain.
